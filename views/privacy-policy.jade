      Privacy Policy
      -------------------
      CompassionPit does not do any kind of server-side logging, and intends for all chats to remain anonymous. If abuse ever becomes a problem, we may be forced to implement some kind of access logging solution in order to ensure the safety of all members, but we will never intercept the contents of your chats.
